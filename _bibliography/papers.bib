  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={The rapid development of affordable and compact high-fidelity sensors (e.g., cameras and LIDAR) allows robots to construct detailed estimates of their states and environments. However, the availability of such rich sensor information introduces two challenges: (i) the lack of analytic sensing models, which makes it difficult to design controllers that are robust to sensor failures, and (ii) the computational expense of processing the high-dimensional sensor information in real time. This paper addresses these challenges using the theory of differential privacy, which allows us to (i) design controllers with bounded sensitivity to errors in state estimates, and (ii) bound the amount of state information used for control (i.e., to impose decision-making under bounded rationality). The resulting framework approximates the separation principle and allows us to derive an upper-bound on the cost incurred with a faulty state estimator in terms of three quantities: the cost incurred using a perfect state estimator, the magnitude of state estimation errors, and the level of differential privacy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework numerically on different robotics problems, including nonlinear system stabilization and motion planning.}

  abstract={A fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning is to learn policies that generalize beyond the operating domains experienced during training. In this paper, we approach this challenge through the following invariance principle: an agent must find a representation such that there exists an action-predictor built on top of this representation that is simultaneously optimal across all training domains. Intuitively, the resulting invariant policy enhances generalization by finding causes of successful actions. We propose a novel learning algorithm, Invariant Policy Optimization (IPO), that implements this principle and learns an invariant policy during training. We compare our approach with standard policy gradient methods and demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance on unseen domains for linear quadratic regulator and grid-world problems, and an example where a robot must learn to open doors with varying physical properties.}

  title={Operator Splitting Covariance Steering for Safe Stochastic Nonlinear Control},
  author={Ratheesh, Akash and Pacelli, Vincent and Saravanos, Augustinos D. and Theodorou, Evangelos A.},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2411.11211},
  year={2024},

  abstract={Most robotics applications are typically accompanied with safety restrictions that need to be satisfied with a high degree of confidence even in environments under uncertainty. Controlling the state distribution of a system and enforcing such specifications as distribution constraints is a promising approach for meeting such requirements. In this direction, covariance steering (CS) is an increasingly popular stochastic optimal control (SOC) framework for designing safe controllers via explicit constraints on the system covariance. Nevertheless, a major challenge in applying CS methods to systems with the nonlinear dynamics and chance constraints common in robotics is that the approximations needed are conservative and highly sensitive to the point of approximation. This can cause sequential convex programming methods to converge to poor local minima or incorrectly report problems as infeasible due to shifting constraints. This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving chance-constrained nonlinear CS problems that directly addresses this challenge. Specifically, we propose an operator-splitting approach that temporarily separates the main problem into subproblems that can be solved in parallel. The benefit of this relaxation lies in the fact that it does not require all iterates to satisfy all constraints simultaneously prior to convergence, thus enhancing the exploration capabilities of the algorithm for finding better solutions. Simulation results verify the ability of the proposed method to find higher quality solutions under stricter safety constraints than standard methods on a variety of robotic systems. Finally, the applicability of the algorithm on real systems is confirmed through hardware demonstrations.}

  abstract={Our goal is to develop theory and algorithms for establishing fundamental limits on performance imposed by a robot’s sensors for a given task. In order to achieve this, we define a quantity that captures the amount of task-relevant information provided by a sensor. Using a novel version of the generalized Fano's inequality from information theory, we demonstrate that this quantity provides an upper bound on the highest achievable expected reward for one-step decision-making tasks. We then extend this bound to multi-step problems via a dynamic programming approach. We present algorithms for numerically computing the resulting bounds, and demonstrate our approach on three examples: (i) the lava problem from the literature on partially observable Markov decision processes, (ii) an example with continuous state and observation spaces corresponding to a robot catching a freely-falling object, and (iii) obstacle avoidance using a depth sensor with non-Gaussian noise. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to establish strong limits on achievable performance for these problems by comparing our upper bounds with achievable lower bounds (computed by synthesizing or learning concrete control policies).},
